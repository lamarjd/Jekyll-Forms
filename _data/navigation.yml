# Jekyll supports loading data from YAML, JSON, and CSV files located in a _data directory. Data files are a great way to separate content from source code to make the site easier to maintain.

# Jekyll makes this data file available to you at site.data.navigation. Instead of outputting each link in _includes/navigation.html, now you can iterate over the data file instead:

- name: Home
  link: /
- name: About
  link: /about.html
- name: Blog
  link: /blog.html
